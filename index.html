        <h5> Google Map vs Privacy</h5>
        <p>Online mapping technologies v.s Privacy
	
	Web mapping technologies has become an important feature for us to use in daily life and traveling. The most popular map, Google Map, brought a lot of convenience because of it’s simplicity and clarity of choices. In 2007, Google Map launched Google Street View that provides panoramic views so users can view the actual image in 360 degrees on their phone or computer. Street View can be a very useful tool for finding direction in unfamiliar places beforehand without physically going to the location. In the other hand, privacy issues has been brought up due to the fact that everyone can view anywhere on the map.Therefore, the concern of criminology using web mapping increased. Blur feature, high-quality images and AI are three of the areas causes the concern of Street View. 
	Google Street View has done a good job blurring people’s faces and license plate and there is a way to prevent strangers from seeing user’s houses through street views. Google provides an option for users to request a blur for specific property, simply type in the address and request. During 2016, Indian government had refused to give Google permission for Street View due to security reasons, they argued that even with the blurring feature a person or car can still be identified by clothing or other distinctive structure. For user-contributed images, the automatic blurring system do not apply, which Google has give first permission to Insta360 Pro recently, users are able to take images of the streets in their own perspective and upload it for Google Street View. Therefore, the automatic blurring technique does not apply in this case, users has to select faces and license plate manually, which  causes privacy to be exposed. For data capturing, Google uses cars with 360 degree angle camera, the update of images were not as fast if there is new buildings or environmental changes. Although images are captured in public areas, in some cases the Street View car would  drive into private roads accidentally or would capture images through windows of private locations. 
	Google is improving Street View with high-resolution camera and AI. Improved AI helps updating business addresses and will be able to capture informations like opening hours and other information. High-quality cameras with improved AI that produces detailed images might increase the privacy invasion crimes. Therefore by using the Street view, criminals are able to locate all the possible entrances and security cameras of the building, observe resident’s car or even measure distances between objects to plan the crime. In countries like South Korea, citizens rely on their South Korean search engine, Naver. Comparing Naver with Google Map, Naver blurred out all their military camps for national security reasons but as opposed to Google Map, users are able to see South Korea’s military camps using Google Street View with clear directions, words and details.
	Google map made big contribution improving the user experience and ability of the technology, with many security concern that it might cause privacy invasion, although it also provides users advantages. It gives us more informations about different locations before actually visiting there and some sensitive information. However, the change of technology will make everything more transparent so it is important to think that there are consequences and advantages in both aspects. </p>
